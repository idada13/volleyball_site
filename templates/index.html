        Originally formed as Cardiff Ladies Volleyball Club in 1979, the club achieved numerous successes over the years.  More recently the club opened its membership to male players. As a result, in 2014 the Club underwent a re-brand and formed Cardiff Volleyball Club.
         
        Our ethos as a Club is to actively encourage training and development for all levels of ability, within a welcoming, friendly and social environment yet still remaining competitive.  We are an ambitious Club, with one of our squads already competing in the National Volleyball League and future plans to increase levels of competition throughout.
         
        If you are new to Volleyball, a returning player or even experienced, we guarantee you will receive a warm welcome.</p>
